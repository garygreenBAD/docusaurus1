# About Frameworks

## Introduction

Frameworks are proven approaches or principles used to guide/ govern a change process.

Typically these focus on the delivery aspects of a product/project. Each framework often 
has a specific version of an activity to specify approaches in a more granular way. We 
have referred to these Activity versions as Framework activities.

## Example Frameworks

* Scrum
* SAFe
* LeSS

etc...
